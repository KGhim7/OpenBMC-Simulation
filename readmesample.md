# Agentic RAG System

A scalable, agent-driven Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system designed to process documents, embed semantic information, and answer user queries using autonomous agents. Built with a clean architecture that separates responsibilities into agents and services, the system is easy to extend, test, and deploy.
Below is the architectural overview of the system showing its modular agents, supporting services, and interaction with external components like Elasticsearch and DeepSeek.

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions
### Software Requirements

```sh
Python v3.12.9 (*)
Elasticsearch v8.12.1 (*)
```

### 1. Clone & Create Environment
```bash
git clone https://github.com/AashishGh/Agentic_RAG_System.git
cd Agentic_RAG_System
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate   # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

###  2. Configure Environment

Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the exact same content as [.env_SAMPLE](.env_SAMPLE) file:

Update username and password based on your elasticsearch server.

## ⚡ GPU Requirements

The Agentic RAG system uses the [`deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B`](https://huggingface.co/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B) model for language generation. This model is highly optimized and distilled, but still requires considerable hardware resources.

### Minimum GPU Requirements

| Requirement        | Recommended Specs                         |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| GPU Model          | NVIDIA A100 / A40 / RTX 4090 / 3090       |
| GPU Memory         | **≥ 16 GB VRAM**                          |
| Precision Support  | bfloat16 or float16 (for quantized loads) |
| CUDA Version       | CUDA 11.7+ or 12.x                        |
| Drivers            | NVIDIA Driver 510+                        |

###  Notes

- For best performance, load the model in `bfloat16` or `float16` precision with `device_map='auto'`.
- Multi-GPU setups using `accelerate` or `deepspeed` are supported if memory is insufficient.
- For CPU-only inference (not recommended), use `bitsandbytes` 4-bit quantization — **very slow**.
- If you are using HuggingFace Transformers, ensure you have `transformers`, `accelerate`, and `flash-attn` installed.

## 📄 Document Format Requirements

Before using the RAG system, all documents must be converted to `.txt` format. The system expects raw text input for chunking and embedding. If you have `.pdf` documents, place all of them in separate folder named <your_domain_name> inside documents/. You can have multiple domain folders inside documents/ <br>
Use the included `text_extracter.py` script to convert all your PDFs in bulk.

```python
python text_extracter.py
```

## ⚙️ How It Works

 **Ingestion**  
`docs_loader.py` loads documents from the `/documents` directory.

 **Chunking**  
`chunker.py` divides large documents into overlapping text windows for context preservation.

 **Embedding**  
`embedder.py` converts text chunks into high-dimensional vectors using a transformer-based model.

 **Indexing**  
`indexer.py` stores these embeddings into a vector database for efficient retrieval.

 **Retrieval**  
`retriever.py` fetches top-k relevant chunks from the index based on semantic similarity to the query.

 **Reasoning & Execution**  
`planner.py`, `reasoner.py`, and `executor.py` collaborate to refine the query and generate accurate, context-rich responses.

 **Serving**  
`api.py` exposes endpoints using FastAPI for document upload and intelligent querying.
The following diagram illustrates the complete lifecycle of a user query in the Agentic RAG System — from subquery decomposition to embedding-based retrieval and final response generation via DeepSeek reasoning.

## 🖥️ Running the Agentic RAG System
To fully run the system, follow these steps in order:
### 1. Start Elasticsearch
Ensure Elasticsearch is running on your machine before launching the backend. Follow [Elasticsearch installation docs](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/starting-elasticsearch.html) to run it locally. <br>
PS: System assumes elastic server to be run at port 9200.

Verify it is running:
```bash
curl http://localhost:9200
```
### FOR FIRST TIME SETUP or when new documents are to be added in the database: 
Index the elastic search with the documents formatted previously as per requirements. To do so:
-  Delete the indices if exist and Index the documents:
```bash
cd src/services/
python delete_index.py
python indexer.py
```

### 2. Launch the FastAPI Backend
Start the FastAPI server from the root directory:
```bash
python main.py
```
By default, the server runs at:
http://127.0.0.1:8000 <br>
You can access: <br>
Swagger UI: http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs <br>
ReDoc: http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc

### 3. Launch the React Frontend (Client)
You can access the client side application made with React JS by accessing `./client` folder and by running the application.
Also, you can find the [Readme.md for React Application](./client/README.md) which guides you through the process to install application locally.

## 🧪 Run Tests

To execute all tests:

```bash
pytest tests/
```
This will run unit tests for both:
agents/ (e.g., chunker, embedder, executor),and 
services/ (e.g., docs_loader, retriever, indexer).

Make sure all dependencies are installed and your environment is properly configured before running tests.
